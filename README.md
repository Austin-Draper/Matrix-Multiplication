# Matrix-Multiplication
THIS PROGRAM WAS UPLOADED TO GITHUB USING VISUAL STUDIO 2015 COMMUNITY EDITION

This program will use x86 assembly to perform a static matrix multiplication

To run, download the ZIP and extract the files. Then navigate to the testassem2015 folder and run testassem2015.exe. 
For now it's just a simple static matrix. I plan on updating this in the future to be dynamic user input size and numbers.
